Overview
This repository contains a simple Python script demonstrating basic list operations. The code showcases common methods to manipulate a list, including appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding the index of an element.
Code Description
The script performs the following steps:

Creates an empty list.
Adds elements using append().
Inserts an element at a specific position with insert().
Extends the list with additional elements using extend().
Removes the last element with pop().
Sorts the list in ascending order using sort().
Finds and prints the index of a specific element using index().

Usage

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/nelsonmaranda/WK2PythonAssignment.git


Navigate to the directory:cd WK2PythonAssignment


Run the script:python wk2Assignment.py

(Ensure Python is installed on your system.)

Output
The script will output the index of the element 30 in the sorted list. For example:
Index of 30: 3

(The exact index may vary based on the final list after operations.)
